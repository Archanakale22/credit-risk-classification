# credit-risk-classification

Data Preparation:
Read the lending_data.csv data into a Pandas DataFrame.
Create labels (y) from the “loan_status” column and features (X) from the remaining columns.
Split the data into training and testing datasets.

Logistic Regression Model:
Fit a logistic regression model using the training data (X_train and y_train).
Save predictions for the testing data labels (X_test) using the fitted model.
Evaluate the model’s performance:
Calculate accuracy score.
Generate a confusion matrix.
Print the classification report.

Credit Risk Analysis Report:
Write a brief report (README.md) summarizing the machine learning model’s performance.
Include accuracy, precision, and recall scores.
Explain the purpose of the analysis.
